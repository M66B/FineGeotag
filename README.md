# Fine Geotag
Automatically geotag photos with a real-time fine location right after they were taken.

The camera application mostly uses the last known location, which could be old and miles away from your current position.

Optionally a popup will be shown with a thumbnail of the photo and the [reverse geocoded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_geocoding) address after geotagging.

Don't forget to disable getagging of your camera application to prevent interference.

Works only for JPEG pictures.

Works on Android 2.3+ (Gingerbread and later).
